The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-30

Affected crates: mqdb-cli.

### Added

- Environment variable support for all `agent start` and `cluster start` CLI flags (`MQDB_BIND`, `MQDB_DB`, `MQDB_DURABILITY`, `MQDB_NODE_ID`, etc.)
- Inline content environment variables for file-path flags: `MQDB_PASSWD`, `MQDB_ACL`, `MQDB_SCRAM`, `MQDB_JWT_KEY`, `MQDB_PASSPHRASE`, `MQDB_LICENSE`, `MQDB_QUIC_CERT`, `MQDB_QUIC_KEY`, `MQDB_QUIC_CA`, `MQDB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `MQDB_IDENTITY_KEY`, `MQDB_FEDERATED_JWT_CONFIG`, `MQDB_CERT_AUTH`
- Precedence: CLI flags > inline env vars (`MQDB_*`) > file-path env vars (`MQDB_*_FILE`)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-28

Affected crates: mqdb-core, mqdb-agent, mqdb-cli.

### Added

- OpenTelemetry tracing with OTLP export for agent mode (`--otlp-endpoint`, `--otel-service-name`, `--otel-sampling-ratio`)
- `#[instrument]` spans on all DB operations (create, read, update, delete, list) and schema/constraint changes
- `Request::operation_label()` method on mqdb-core transport types
- W3C traceparent correlation from incoming MQTT messages through to DB operation spans

### Changed

- Switched to independent per-crate versioning (workspace version removed)
- Deferred tracing subscriber initialization for `agent start` to avoid conflict with mqtt-lib's OTLP subscriber
- Extracted `AgentStartFields` struct from `AgentAction::Start` enum variant (clippy large_enum_variant fix)
